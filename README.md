Primarily, you would use JSE much the same way you would use any scripting
interpreter; to create system specific applications written in script. You can
get started with JSE right away by going to the
[Download](https://github.com/hypersoft/jse/wiki/Download) page where you can
learn how to acquire and build the source.
