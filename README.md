[JSE](https://github.com/hypersoft/jse/wiki/About-JSE) is a [GNU/Linux project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) conceptualized and maintained by [Hypersoft](https://github.com/hypersoft/) [(Triston J.Taylor)](mailto:pc.wiz.tt@gmail.com)

JSE is a great engine for general application scripting. You can touch on everything,
from advanced to beginner, all depending on how comfortable you are with learning,
trying, and building great things.

If you require a more thorough approach (matured operations libraries), for your enterprise,
capabilities, make no mistakes, JSE is probably the best tool for the task, but it is
a tool of tools, and it doesn't come with many. Here is a JavaScript great toolkit 
known as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Node comes with specific enterprise designs in
mind. Node.js scripts are not compatible with JSE scripts either.

You can get started with JSE right away by going to the [Download](https://github.com/hypersoft/jse/wiki/Download) page where you can learn how to acquire and build the source.

JSE is a free and open source project, that could greatly use your support. Help JSE
reach its Goal for 2014 to raise $10,000.00!

Funds Raised to date: $0.00 (Impeccably Impoverished)
